# Staying Healthy <span class="on-road">While on the Road</span>

The challenge of healthy nomading is that finding ourselves in a completely new environment every 30 days makes keeping to any routine with diet, exercise, etc is almost impossible. This, in addition to us trying to take full advantage of new opportunities, experiences, and fantastic foods that surround us, make it tricky to have a single plan in place that we can stick to consistently.  

<span class="on-road">Since Michelle and I view our travels as a lifestyle and not an extended vacation,</span> it was important for us to try to stay healthy in all aspects. <span class="on-road">We even ended up being healthier than we were back home in some cases. </span>

## Nutritionally

I'm a big believer in the phrase 'You are what you consume' - (I know the phrase is 'you are what you eat', but I prefer consume as it's more representative of what makes people. In my mind this also includes any drinking, substances, media, books, etc, not simply food). The first facet of staying healthy for us was going to be looking into what we put into our bodies. We have experimented in the past with different diets for weekly cadences in order to expand our food diversity, but we wanted to go deeper here. We wanted to understand how certain foods affect us, and how they can be used to our advantage. 

Both Michelle and I signed up for 10 sessions with a nutritionist through [OnPoint Nutrition](https://www.onpoint-nutrition.com/). This is a remote nutritionist who speaks to you either once or twice per week, can help you set nutrition goals, and, most importantly, keeps you accountable. This program helped us understand what we consume and we tracked all of our meals for the entire duration of our sessions. This was extremely helpful for us in the long term to stay healthy.

<span class="on-road">Specifically for us, since we're on the road and have no real constants in our lives with respect to foods available to us,</span> we put forward a plan to try and at least be consistent and thoughtful about our meals. The biggest part of this for us is breakfast. We try to keep consistent with a breakfast of eggs and vegetables wherever we are. <span class="on-road">(Of course, we can also mix this up a bit, for example, adding a baguette between the two of us when we were in France ü•ñ or hummus when we were in Isarel üòã.)</span> This breakfast sets us on a good path for the day, spares us carbs for later in the day, and already gets in a serving of vegetables! ü•¶

We also try to cook as much as possible at home. Ok, well, Michelle cooks at home. This is good for our stomachs, as well as our wallets. It is quite tempting to simply eat out all the time when you're constantly surrounded by <span class="on-road">new and</span> delicious foods, but we try to keep our intake to what we know as much as possible. 

Michelle is allergic to nuts and has several different food restrictions that make all of this even harder. I have become an expert 'nut tester' for those many moments where we can't communicate with the server or cooks. 

### Pro Tips

- Try and avoid carbs for breakfast. It's best to 'save' them for later in the day. 
- Think of 1 alcoholic drink as 1 carb serving. That might help put your weekends into perspective ;)
- Go out of your way to eat as much fruit as you can. This was very difficult for me as eating 3 servings of fruit per day was something I've never really done on a consistent basis. 
- If you overeat, overeat veggies! 
- Portion size carries a lot of weight (literally). Sometimes when eating out, Michelle and I will split an appetizer and an entree if we're not very hungry. 
- Have an easy and healthy snack ready to go for most situations. For me, this is peanuts (which I can never have enough of..). Other good alternatives are Greek yogurt (not always easy for 'on the go', but easy for at home munching) or a piece of fruit. Ideally your go-to snack doesn't contain carbs.

## Physically

The next obvious stop on our staying healthy as nomads tour is staying physically fit. This was definitely easier said than done as we didn't have much of a routine in place <span class="on-road">even before we left on our trip</span>. 

The most important word in the previous paragraph is routine. What I've found is that it's much easier to do even a small workout every day or every 2 days, than 1 larger workout once a week. Getting in the habit will help give you compound results when it comes to staying fit. 

<span class="on-road">Again, a nomad's main issue here is that we don't have many constants between where we're staying and traveling to. </span>

When affordable, we seek out Airbnb's and accomodations with a gym and/or pool in the apartment building - that's a win! When we do have that, we try to take advantage of that as much as possible. I'm not much of a pool guy, but Michelle likes going for a short swim after a workout to cool down üèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so I go and keep her company.

In some places we stay at, we actually look for a nearby gym membership. If the price is reasonable, it's not too far away, and has the equipment we need, we sign up! The good thing about paying for a gym membership is it motivates you to go everyday since you get more bang (or muscle üí™) for your buck. 

If the weather is good <span class="on-road">where we're staying and the lay of the land is pretty simple</span>, Michelle and I opt for jogging. This is a bit more difficult to do everyday, but you get in more of a sweat. We started small, especially me, as I was never a jogger. But you can slowly build up, become more comfortable, and start running longer distances. 

And finally, the real secret to us staying physically fit on the road is the last scenario: simply working out at home. This has the smallest barrier to entry, and done right, you can still get great workouts into your daily routine. The secret waepon for us was the [Nike Training Club app]((https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nike-plus/training-app)). They have a myriad of varied workouts for different muscle groups or fitness level. There are plenty of no equipment/body weight work outs available, perfect for the aspiring healthy nomad who doesn't have the luggage space for a 10 pound dumbell.  When I do a Nike Training workout, I try to do a 15-20 minute full body workout, followed by a 6-12 minute core workout. This leaves me sweating and feeling good about the rest of my day!

You can be doubly productive during your workout and listen to a news podcast, audiobook, or something similar. Michelle listens to [Rachel Madow](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-rachel-maddow-show-podcasts), while I listen to the [NYT Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily). Just make sure it's not too funny, or you might lose your step on the treadmil. The more distracting what you're listening to, the better! You're just trying to get your routine going. 

### Pro Tips

- Download the [Nike Training Club app](https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nike-plus/training-app). 
- Try to find a routine, in whatever way you can get it to fit your day-to-day. Early riser? Get it done before work so it's smooth sailing. Like staying up late watching TV? Try a workout during one of your go-to shows that you can quote from memory. 
- Skip as few days as possible, even if you're just doing a few minutes of activity. The more days you are able to set aside time for yourself to work out, the easier it will be in the future. 
- Find the workouts that work for you. Runner? Great, bring it on. Do something that you can somewhat enjoy to make it easier to do rather than coming up with excuses why you shouldn't. 
- Be sure to diversify your wokrout every so often so you don't get too comfortable with one workout and neglect other muscles in your body. 

**Current Status: Most physically fit I've been consistently for the duration of over 6 months.**

## Mentally

Certainly a large part of staying healthy but most often overlooked, is our mental health. <span class="on-road">Traveling for so long at a time, never having a true home base, being away from family and friends, being torn away from friends you make constantly, digital nomading is quite mentally draining.</span> We've come up with certain tricks along the way to help make it more digestable and manageable. 

<span class="on-road">First and foremost, you've heard me say it before and I'll say it again, slow travel is the way to go. We typically stay in 1 country, and usually only 1 accomodation in that country for 1 month at a time ([mini trips](https://wherethehellaretomerandmichelle.com/journal/mini-trips.html) excluded, but with mini trips you don't have to take all of your belongings with you). This means that we are able to focus more on the *experience* of traveling, as opposed to the *act* of traveling. We've done the hopping around, consisting of a few days here, a short stint there, while trying to absorb everything in that short amount of time. It's exhausting. And especially if you're working while on the road, it makes it all but impossible. </span>

Try to make your accomodation as homey as possible. <span class="on-road">We unpack our suitcase when we arrive to whatever dressers/drawers are available to us.</span> We bring our Roku player and plug it into the TV so we have our shows readily available. We even went so far as to get 2 travel-sized Christmas decorations and have already used it at 2 different accomodations! üéäüéÑ

### Socially

Socially (and also much more than socially), I'm eternally thankful for Michelle. She's not only my better half, but I'd go crazy if I didn't have her to talk to and get through tough situations. It's no surprise that as a couple <span class="on-road">traveling</span> long term, you get to know each other really well in lots of different situations. 

When it comes to trying to meet new people, we look towards [CouchSurfing meetups](https://www.couchsurfing.com/events) and [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) (though we have had more luck with CouchSurfing meetups). In most of our stays, there was usually a weekly get-together at some local bar where ex-pats, travelers, and locals alike congregate. Not going to lie, it is quite hit-or-miss depending on what week you end up going to. But we have met some cool people and had great times through these meetups.

With regards to our family and friends, we try to take the initiative of calling them and keeping in touch - <span class="on-road">it was us who decided to leave</span>, after all. I speak to my family about twice per week, and try to catch up with a different friend about once per week (though I know I've been failing there, bear with me, friends!). 

It's also very important to have your 'me time' and maybe a hobby or two. Alone time is great to simply go through your thoughts and let your mind's thinking take its course. This *is* coming from an introvert, but when <span class="on-road">traveling</span> with someone who is by you side 24/7, it's important to 'plug in' for a bit. Michelle and I have different sleep schedules, she's a night owl and I'm a morning person. We leverage this to ensure we each have some alone time. In terms of hobbies, it's good to keep your brain on edge and keep sharpening it. I took up the [NYT Daily Crossword](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords) and try to complete 1 puzzle per day. It gets me something to do everyday, can be social if I choose to make it so, and diversifies my day. 

### Pro Tips

- Look for meetups and other local events happening nearby; don't be afraid to strike up conversation, that's what everyone is there for! If there's no local meetup, create one! 
- Find your alone time. Even when <span class="on-road">traveling</span> with your partner, be sure there is some time apart during the day to catch up with your thoughts. 
- Pick a small time hobby you can take up as something you can work on while on the road. <span class="on-road">Ideally it's something 'travel proof' and small so you can bring it along with you. </span>
