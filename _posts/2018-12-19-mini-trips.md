While we are able to see some of our most coveted cities around the world, what would experiencing local culture be like if we never stepped outside of the city? We've taken 3 of these 'mini-trips' so far. For these 3 different mini-trips, we compacted our stuff into a smaller collection of stuff and hit the road! 

## Porto, Portugal

Porto is a port town (no kidding!) about 3 hours north of Lisbon. Even before we landed in Lisbon we had heard rumblings of Porto, their beautiful town, and delicious wine. The more we talked to locals there, we realized we couldn't leave the country without a quick visit. Maybe it was the weather there, or maybe the combination of Port wine and Sangaria, but that was one of the more enjoyable weekends of the whole trip so far.

## Zurich, Switzerland

We had heard Switzerland was extremely cold and even more expensive. It wouldn't have made it on our itinerary if it weren't for my family that lives there. They live in Cham, Swizerland, about 45 minutes outside of Zurich, one of the world's largest financial capitals. Knowing we couldn't have visited Switzerland without a pitstop at its capital, we booked us 2 nights mid-week there. We had a great time visiting the large Christmas market there, worked out of a cool coworking spot there ([Thank God It's Monday](https://www.coworker.com/switzerland/zurich/tgim-thank-god-its-monday-zurich) - great name!), and had some great fondue!

## Edinburgh, Scotland

Glasgow, Scotland is Michelle's home. And to locals there, Edinburgh might as well be on the other side of the planet. That being said, it's a gorgeous and historic city with a lot to experience. We took 3 nights in an Airbnb there and maximized our time to the fullest. We went to the Christmas market there (noticing a pattern??), visited the Edinburgh castle, and climbed Arthur's Seat.

Mini trips. Trip within a trip. Tripception. Call it what you want, but they are definitely worth it!
