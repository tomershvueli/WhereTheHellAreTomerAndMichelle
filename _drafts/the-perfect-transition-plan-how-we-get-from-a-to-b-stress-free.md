Travel days are stressful, we all know that. And being that we live on the road, we tend to have more travel days than most people. So we've come up with a system to help reduce friction where possible, making for a seamless transition on travel days!

~~One comment we get a lot is, 'you must be pretty good at packing by now!' It's true, we've had quite a bit of experience in the past 8 months! We pretty much have it down to a science by now. Here is the science we've come up with for a perfect transition plan for places with 1 month stays.~~

## 7 Days Before

### This is when we start taking notice and preparing for our imminent departure.

* Make a list of any things we want to do and haven't done yet, or any things we want to do again before we leave. Restaurants highly considered.
* Make plans to see anyone we want to see again (family, friends, or acquaintances we met at local CouchSurfing meetups).
* Start looking at our fridge and non-perishables to make the most out of what we bought and reduce unnecessary waste.

## 6 - 3 Days Before

* One more grocery run to make sure we have enough meals to last us.
* One final load of laundry.
* Be sure we have a plan for our travel day in the way of: we know what time to leave our house and how to checkout, how we're getting to the airport/train station, and we have off of work that day if it's on a weekday.
  * To get to our departure point, we try and see if public transportation is available, otherwise, we schedule a cab.
* Soak in the rest of our stay!

## 2 Days Before

* Potentially make a reservation for the night we get in for a casual, local restaurant. This helps make sure that we can come in stress free and don't need to rush to make dinner.
* Should start packing. Probably don't.

## 1 Day Before

* Try and get some snacks/fruits for travel day. Hunger + travel stress = not happy Tomer.
* Download entertainment to our phones for travel time, books, podcasts, music, and some Netflix shows we may want.
* Make sure we have check in instructions for our [AirBNB](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/c/tshvueli?currency=USD) (we usually book these months in advance - no need to search around when we land).
* Confirm travel day plans, transportation, times, etc.
* Check in to our flight, if applicable.
* Make a dinner with all of our leftover food!
* Actually pack.
* Plug in our laptops and phones overnight.

## Travel Day is here!

### We usually book our transport in the mornings. This allows us to get into our destination and still have some of the day to settle in before we are up and at 'em!

* Get up way too early just in case (at least that's my M.O., not Michelle's).
* Do a final sweep of the house to make sure we haven't left anything behind.
* Struggle to squish our toiletries bag into our already-full suitcase.
* [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com "Google Maps"): Download an offline map of the city we're headed to and set our AirBNB's address to 'Home' label. Try to commit the address to memory - probably fail.
* Use our Chase Sapphire card's Priority Pass benefit to hang out in any lounges at the airport. This is a nice relief in a (relatively) quiet place with some free munchies and drinks.
* Try to beat the line to Passport Control by walking fast, stop by the bathroom, end up at the end of line.
* Get cash out at a nearby ATM using our trusty [Charles Schwab card with ATM-fee rebates](https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/refer-prospect.html?refrid=REFER6TNWV7HU). If the option is provided, don't use the ATM's conversion, take cash out in the local currency, this leads to a better conversion rate.
* Find transportation to our [AirBNB](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/c/tshvueli?currency=USD). Check in. Plug into the Wifi.
* If we're at this destination for a month, start unpacking our suitcase into drawers - stop halfway.
* Walk around in the evening and see what our neighborhood is like and spot interesting things to do.
* Find local grocery store and get staples for breakfast.

## 1 Day After

* Full grocery run.
* Check for interesting CouchSurfing meetups coming up.
* Look for interesting things to do in the new city.
* If we're not 'in town', take public transport to visit downtown and make note of interesting looking places.
* Check to see if there are interesting AirBNB local experiences we want to sign up for during our stay.
