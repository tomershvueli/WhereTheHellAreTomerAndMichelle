title: A Note from Tomer and Michelle
---
Tomer and Michelle are traveling and working remotely otherwise known as “Digital Nomading”. 

We are traveling with no true purpose or goal other than to live within a culture and learn by doing, while eating as much good food along the way as we can. Michelle will be documenting restaurants, recipes, and signature dishes and Tomer will be speaking to the overall digital experiences of nomading and anything else that crosses his mind. We invite you to follow along and feel free to get in touch via our email or comment on our posts with questions or suggestions!
